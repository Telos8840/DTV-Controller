# DTV-Controller
This desktop controller was used as a middleware to setup and control a large touchscreen application used by DirecTV. It also synced to an iPad application in order to remotely control the large touchscreen app. It kept a SQL database and the touchscreen app in sync in order to view live realtime football statistics.
